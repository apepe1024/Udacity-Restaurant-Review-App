# Udacity Restaurant Review App

This is the final project for the "Front End Applications" section of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

### Known Bugs

* In the console: "Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined"
  * Sometimes this will happen when going back to the root from a restaurant. Map still shows up, pins still show up on the map, so I feel like this is just the nature of working with an async request to an API.

## Getting Started

$ npm i
```
